Real Time Bus Tracking Repository
Mapbox is used to mark bus stop locations for a college bus route in the Boston area. 

This project demonstrates the following concepts: 
- using maps from MapBox
- adding markers to the map
- moving the markers using latitude/longditude data
- a menu selection to change the styling of the map
- an expand to full screen mapbox option

I had fun adding a menu for the user to select a styling option and expand to full screen. The class assignment was refactored to break up the single source file into .html, .js, and .css files for easier maintance.

###How to Run
Anyone can run this file by downloading the repository and loading the index.html file to a browser.

###Future Improvements
Add real time data to update the current location of the bus and map that for the user.
